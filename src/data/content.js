The FCA client money regime, as set out in the FCA’s Client Asset Sourcebook, will also not apply to our provision of the Services to You.",

Enigma does not accept any liability for losses resulting from its insolvency or the insolvency of a Third-Party Account Provider. Your claim in respect of Crypto if such a claim arises following the insolvency of the Enigma Wallet holder may be limited to an unsecured debt claim, and the Crypto or cash sum You receive in respect of Your Crypto may be insufficient to satisfy Your Account balance",
