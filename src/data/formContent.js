  "Terms of Use": "Terms of Use",
  "Terms of Use description": `**1. Acceptance of the Terms**
  
      **1.1**   These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) set out the terms and conditions under which you (“You” or “Your” as appropriate) can trade cryptocurrencies, for example Bitcoin or Ethereum (“Crypto” or “Cryptocurrency”) using Enigma Securities Limited as a broker (the “Service”). Enigma Securities Ltd (“Enigma”, “Us”, “We” or “Our” as appropriate) is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 11114339 and registered office located at Gossard House, 7/8 Saville Row, London, W1S 3PE, United Kingdom. Enigma is an Appointed Representative of Makor Securities London Ltd which is authorised and regulated (Reference No: 625054) by the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”). 
  
      **1.2**   You acknowledge and agree that by engaging with Enigma, placing any funds with us to execute transactions or generally using the Service in any way, You will be deemed to have accepted these Terms. You understand that each order submitted to Enigma (whether by voice broking, email or via any other electronic interface that We may provide and/or accept) may result in Your entry into one or more binding transactions (a “Transaction”). You assume full financial and performance responsibility for all such Transactions created as a result of the process set out in these Terms.
  
      **2. Amendment to the Terms**
  
      Unless We consider any amendment to be a material change to the Terms (in which case we will provide You with not less than 7 (seven) days’ prior notice (a “Notice”)), We reserve the right to amend the Terms at any time without prior notice to You. All changes shall take effect immediately and an updated version of the Terms shall be published on Our website. If You do not agree to any amendment then You should stop using the Service immediately.
  
      **3. Risks**
  
      **3.1**   Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are not currently classified as a type of regulated financial instrument under the current European regulatory framework (including MiFID II). This means that the Service and Related Services are not governed by the same rules and regulations that apply to similar services relating to other products, for example, derivatives. You will not therefore benefit from the statutory client money protections available to clients receiving regulated investment services, including access to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and the Financial Ombudsman for dispute resolution. The FCA client money regime, as set out in the FCA’s Client Asset Sourcebook, will also not apply to our provision of the Services to You.
  
      **3.2**   The risk of loss in trading or holding Cryptocurrency can be high. The price of a given Cryptocurrency can vary greatly in a very short space of time. Many Cryptocurrencies are not backed by any asset, commodity or central bank. You should ensure that You fully understand these risks and You may therefore wish to take legal or financial advice before using the Service or placing any order. 
  
      **4. Users **
  
      **4.1**   You must set up and maintain an account to use the Service and submit orders (an “Account”). Your eligibility to use the Service will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and may depend on the country where You reside.. Enigma reserves the right to refuse to allow You to establish an account or use the Service for any reason at its absolute discretion. 
  
      **4.2**   You represent and warrant that Your use of the Service, and Your entry into each Transaction to which You become a party complies with applicable law and regulation in Your jurisdiction, including but not limited to: (i) legal capacity and any other applicable legal requirements in Your jurisdiction for trading Cryptocurrency and using the Service, (ii) any foreign exchange or regulatory restrictions applicable to Your use of the Service, and (iii) the receipt of any governmental or other consents (or exemptions) that You may need to be obtain prior to Your use of the Service. 
  
      **5. Agency**
  
      By accepting the Terms, You hereby irrevocably appoint Enigma to enter into Transactions on Your behalf as agent. Nothing in these Terms shall be deemed, nor shall cause, You and Enigma to be treated as partners or joint ventures. 
  
      **6. The Service **
  
      **6.1**   We will process Your orders in relation to Crypto at our absolute discretion. In order to provide the Service, Enigma may rely on data and prices of third party exchanges and/or arrange for orders to be executed with or through an unaffiliated third party (the “Related Services”). You acknowledge and understand that Enigma has no responsibility or liability for the provision of the Related Services, which, whether provided by an affiliate or otherwise, are outside the scope the Terms. Any authority granted by You to Enigma shall extend to the providers of the Related Services, where applicable. 
  
      **6.2**   The Service includes Crypto brokerage services (namely the buying and selling of Crypto) and acting as Your agent in relation to these brokerage services. Enigma shall not, nor is it under any obligation to, provide You with any advice in relation to the merits or suitability of any Transaction and You are required to rely on Your own judgement before submitting any order to Us. 
  
      **7. Orders **
  
      **7.1**   You must submit all orders in accordance with these Terms and/or the Enigma Website if applicable. You acknowledge that We reserve the right to decline any order for any reason (including Your breach of the Terms, inadequate funds in Your Account, or market conditions). 
  
      **7.2**   If, following acceptance but before execution of Your order, an event takes place which, in Our reasonable opinion, means it is no longer reasonable to execute such order (for example regulatory action, change in law or following the request of an applicable third-party exchange), You acknowledge that We may cancel Your order without any liability to You (and update Your account balance accordingly). 
  
      **7.3**   Irrespective of the time at which (or medium by which) You place an order, You agree to pay or receive the price at the time the associated Transaction is executed. You acknowledge and understand that the nature of the Crypto market means that the price at which Your Transaction is executed may vary significantly from the price indicated at the time of Your order. Enigma is not liable for any such price fluctuations. The Service is independent of any exchanges and We are under no obligation to quote or refer to a particular price or index. 
  
      **7.4**   We will use our reasonable endeavours to act upon any request to cancel or amend an order. You acknowledge and agree that if We are unable to cancel or amend an order, You will be bound by the resultant Transaction. You agree to accept the price in which Transactions are executed as final and binding. 
  
      **7.5**   Funds associated with pending orders will not be included in Your Account balance and may not be used to enter into further orders until the original order is cancelled or executed. 
  
      **7.6**   You acknowledge and understand that all Transactions are entered into on a matched principal basis and Enigma owes You no fiduciary duty in the course of providing the Service. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these Terms shall preclude Enigma (or any other party approved by Enigma at Our absolute discretion) from acting as a market maker (“Market Making Activity”). Any terms, conditions, agreements or rules in relation to Market Making Activity shall be provided separately. 
  
      **8. Funds **
  
      **8.1**   Firm orders given must be pre-funded. All purchase orders to buy Crypto must be pre-funded with an amount of fiat currency at least equal to the relevant purchase price plus any associated fees. All sell orders to dispose of Crypto must be pre-funded with: 
      (i) the associated number of Crypto; and 
      (ii) an amount of fiat currency at least equal to the associated fee. If You do not hold the requisite funds and/or Crypto, we will reject the order. A list of fiat currencies We accept is available on Our website (“Accepted Currency”) or will be communicated to You in due course. If You attempt to make a deposit in any currency other than an Accepted Currency, the deposit may be rejected. 
  
      **8.2**   It is Your responsibility to ensure that You hold sufficient cleared funds and Crypto (as applicable) to satisfy the settlement of any Transaction. The Service does not include the provision of margin. 
  
      **9. Price **
  
      **9.1**   You acknowledge and understand that when You enter into a Transaction via the Service, the fee for the Transaction will be a fee determined by Us, taking into account market conditions. Such price may include a spread (the “Spread”) as against the price available to Us to fill Your order. You acknowledge and understand that the size of the Spread can vary dependent on market conditions. 
  
      **9.2**   You also acknowledge that any third-party fees, such as conversion charges and/or card processing fees, will be passed on to You (“Third Party Fees” and together with the Spread, the “Fees”). 
  
      **10. Cash Account**
  
      **10.1**   We will establish and maintain one or more bank accounts to hold funds on Your behalf. All funds shall be credited to Your Account. All funds held on Your behalf will be held in accounts in Our name, or in that of a third- party firm, which may be an affiliate of ours (including, without limitation, Makor Securities London Limited) (a “Third Party Account Provider”).
  
      **10.2**   You acknowledge and understand that: (i) Your funds may not be segregated from, and may therefore be held in the same bank account as, Enigma’s own funds and/ or other users of the Service; (ii) We will not (and our affiliates will not) use or dispose of Your funds without Your prior express instruction; (iii) the rules and regulations of the FCA’s Client Asset Sourcebook do not apply to You and/or Your use of the Service and Related Services and therefore You may not benefit from the FCA client money regime for the protection of Your funds; (iv) the transfer of funds from You to Us is solely referable to Your purchase of Cryptocurrency and is not therefore a deposit as defined under the FCA rules; (v) in the event of our insolvency, You will rank as an unsecured creditor of ours for return of such funds; and (vi) in the event of insolvency in relation to the Third Party Account Provider, Enigma may only have an unsecured debt claim against the Third Party Account Provider on Your behalf and the money received by Enigma in respect of Your funds may be insufficient to satisfy Your Account balance. Enigma does not accept any liability for losses resulting from its insolvency or the insolvency of a Third-Party Account Provider. 
  
      **10.3**   In respect of the transfer of the funds, we will aim to credit Your Account with the corresponding amount of fiat currency within 1 business day of the relevant bank transfer. In respect of withdrawals, we will immediately debit Your Account with the corresponding amount of fiat currency following Your authorisation. The corresponding funds will then settle to Your bank account within 3 business days. We are not responsible for any delay in the settlement of a Transaction resulting from circumstances beyond our control, including any third-party systems failure. 
  
      **11. Crypto**
  
      **11.1**   We will (or a service provider will on Our behalf) establish and maintain one or more digital wallets to hold Crypto on Your behalf (an “Enigma Wallet”). You will at all times retain beneficial ownership interest in all Crypto transferred by You to Us or bought by Us on Your behalf in an amount equal to the balance of Your Account. You acknowledge and understand that: 
      (i) Your Crypto may be held in the same Enigma Wallet as other users of the Service; 
      (ii) We will not (and our service providers will not) use or dispose of Your Crypto without Your prior express instruction; and 
      (iii) Your claim in respect of Crypto following the insolvency of the Enigma Wallet holder may be limited to an unsecured debt claim, and the Crypto or cash sum You receive in respect of Your Crypto may be insufficient to satisfy Your Account balance. 
  
      **11.2**   You acknowledge and understand that the Crypto Which Enigma supports may change from time to time. 
  
      **11.3**   You will not be entitled to interest in respect of any funds or Crypto held by Us, a Third-Party Account Provider or an Enigma Wallet holder. 
  
      **11.4**   As described above, Your money and Cryptocurrency will not be segregated. Consequently, If We or a Third- Party Account Provider become insolvent, there may be delays in identifying individual assets, increasing the risk of loss. 
  
      **12. Tax**
  
      It is Your sole responsibility to determine whether and to what extent any taxes apply to the Transactions and, if applicable to report and remit the correct payment to the appropriate tax authorities. Enigma does not and will not provide any advice with respect to the tax implications of Your entry into Transactions. 
  
      **13. Delivery**
  
      Following the execution of a Transaction, delivery will occur on Enigma’s records and Your Account balance will be updated accordingly. 
  
      **14. Security**
